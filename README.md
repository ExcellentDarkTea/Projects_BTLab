# PhD Projects and Publications

Welcome to the repository for my PhD researchs projects at University of Calgary. This repository collects all the projects I am working on during my PhD, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Reasoning. 

The repository is designed to facilitate collaboration, review, and further research.
Here, you will find:
- Data and code used for experiments
- Results and analyses
- Related publications where these results were published
Each project is meticulously documented to provide insights into the methodologies, tools, and technologies employed. The repository is designed to facilitate collaboration, review, and further research.
