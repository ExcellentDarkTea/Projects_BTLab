# PhD Projects and Publications

Welcome to the repository for my PhD researchs projects at University of Calgary. This repository collects all the projects I am working on during my PhD, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Reasoning. 

The repository is designed to facilitate collaboration, review, and further research.
Here, you will find:
- Data and code used for experiments
- Results and analyses
- Related publications where these results were published

For more information about our lab and ongoing research, please visit the [Biometric Technologies Laboratory](https://ucalgary.ca/labs/biometric-technologies/home).
